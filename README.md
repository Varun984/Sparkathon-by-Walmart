Ever seen one warehouse look like it got hit by a tornado,
while the other is basically a warehouse on vacation?
Yeah — it’s not just inefficient… it’s chaos with a barcode. 📦💥

But what if…
instead of waiting for stock to scream,
we could whisper to it in real-time?

🎯 Introducing our AI-powered inventory whisperer —
a real-time redistribution engine that predicts demand before it knocks,
and moves stock across nearby zones
faster than you can say “out of stock.”

It starts with a demand forecasting pipeline —
No data? No worries.
We crafted our own logic —
mathematical intuition to get things rolling.
Then came ARIMA,
and once things matured, LSTM stepped in —
forecasting like a seasoned oracle. 🔮

Then comes the magic:
We don’t just predict — we act.
Zoom into our UI —
you’ll see micro-fulfillment centers and inventories mapped live using Google Maps.
We calculate distances, check availability, assess urgency —
and boom:
our load balancer finds exactly where stock should go.
From one inventory space to another nearby.
No chaos. Just calm, optimized logistics.

📈 And what about sudden spikes?
We’ve got that covered too.
Our system constantly monitors demand shifts in real-time,
assigning statuses that speak human:
Green is all good. Yellow is time to prep. Red? Time to move.
No panic — just proactive precision.

🧠 Now let’s geek out a bit.
This ain’t your average stack.
We brought the Avengers:
FastAPI for APIs,
C++ for raw algorithmic power,
and TypeScript to bridge with db and yeah we got one seamless backend dance. 🕺

Under the hood?
Drizzle ORM meets Neon PostgreSQL —
the fastest, sharpest, cloud-native duo we could find.
Because performance and sanity should go hand in hand.

Controbution: Added preprocessing and prediction logic for model implementation.
